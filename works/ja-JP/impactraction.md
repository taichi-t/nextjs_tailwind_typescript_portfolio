## What I did as team

developed front-end architecture, boiler-plate, reviewed member's code as a tech lead ðŸ‘€

## Technologies

The client needed the website to be editable and display faster, also enable visitors for the websites to subscribe to newsletters, so that we introduced Server-Side Rendering **(SSR)**, a Headless Contents Management System **(Contentful)** and Customer Relationship Management system **(Agile CMS)**.
