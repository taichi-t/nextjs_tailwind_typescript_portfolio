## What is Authenticator

Full-stack application for just authenticating made of TypeScript.

## Why I created

To understand how authentication flow works. I thought that the part of authentication is more difficult and important than others when it comes to applications. Also, most applications have an auth feature. So I decided to build it to comprehend every single detail of authentication flow.
