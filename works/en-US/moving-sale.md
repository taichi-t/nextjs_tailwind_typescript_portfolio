## What is Moving Sale

A platform for selling and buying products user-to-userðŸ‘€

## Technologies

It is build up with React(Next.js), MongoDB and Node.js. In this project, I focused on responsiveness. For instance, SWR(stale-while-revalidate) allows client-side to cache data, so no need to fetch to a server when users visit once more, it means reducing wasteful data fetching. Furthermore, it used SSR (Server Side Rendering), so a server-side pre-renders web-page, it enables client-side displaying faster than no SSR.
