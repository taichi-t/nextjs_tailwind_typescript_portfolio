## What is My Work Space

My Work Space is an advanced Todo List. You can add your Todo, and organize them order by weeks, or projects etc. In this project, I focus on UI, for instance you can toggle dark mode or light mode, choose a color theme. It's no need SignUp, your todo is saved as local data. Let's get started My Work Space ðŸ”¥
