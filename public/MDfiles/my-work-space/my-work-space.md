## What is My Work Space

My Work Space is **an advanced Todo List**. You can add your tasks and organize them by weeks, or projects etc. In this project, I focus on UI, for instance you can toggle dark mode or light mode, choose a color theme.

It's no need sign-up, your todo is saved automatically. Let's get started My Work Space ðŸ”¥
