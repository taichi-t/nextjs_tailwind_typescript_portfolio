## How it works

This is my personal portfolio that built up with Next.js, TailwindCSS and TypeScript. In this project, focused on responsiveness, worked on the below,

- Installed Server-Side rendering **(Next.js)**
- Implemented Progressive Web Apps **(PWA)**
- Implemented fetching the files of the page user might visit in advance
- Compressed images to the proper size

It got the **96 scores** with google speed insight.
